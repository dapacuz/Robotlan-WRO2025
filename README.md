Engineering materials
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the National WRO El Salvador Future Engineers competition in the season 2025.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the Robotlan-team (an official one and one funny photo)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.)
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed in Arduino IDE to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, and laser cutting machines to produce the vehicle elements.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It includes documentation (how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc.

## Introduction

_This part must be filled by participants with the technical clarifications about the code: which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicleâ€™s controllers._
